# Future Roadmap 🗺️

FocusTree is just a sapling. Here is our vision for a mature forest.

## Phase 1: The "Roots" (Backend & Sync)
*   [ ] **Firebase Integration**: Replace Mock/LocalStorage with real Firebase Auth and Firestore.
*   [ ] **Cross-Device Sync**: Start a session on desktop, track stats on mobile.
*   [ ] **Offline Mode**: Better handling of connection drops during active sessions with queueing.

## Phase 2: The "Forest" (Social)
*   [ ] **Multiplayer Forests**: Focus together with friends. See their trees growing in real-time.
*   [ ] **Accountability Partners**: Get notified when a friend gets distracted (optional).
*   [ ] **Leaderboards**: Weekly focus challenges.

## Phase 3: The "Ecosystem" (Integrations)
*   [ ] **Calendar Integration**: Auto-start sessions based on Google Calendar "Focus Time" blocks.
*   [ ] **Task Sync**: Import tasks from Notion/Todoist to set as "Working On" context.
*   [ ] **Screen Blocking**: Desktop app companion to block distracting websites/apps during sessions.

## Phase 4: Advanced AI
*   [ ] **Personalized Models**: Fine-tune the distraction detection based on the user's specific room/lighting setup.
*   [ ] **Predictive Interventions**: AI warns you *before* you get distracted based on posture or facial fatigue analysis.
*   [ ] **Voice Cloning**: Use the user's own "inner voice" (or a celebrity clone) for coaching.

## Monetization Strategy
*   **Freemium**: Basic timer + Standard Tree.
*   **Pro ($5/mo)**: Advanced AI Insights, Custom Skins/Trees, Unlimited History.
*   **Team**: Enterprise plans for remote teams to stay productive.
